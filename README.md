# NetPractice

*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by jbelkerf* [cite: 202 214]

## Description
[cite_start]NetPractice is a practical exercise designed to introduce the basics of computer networking[cite: 14]. [cite_start]The objective is to configure small-scale networks by adjusting IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways to ensure proper communication between devices[cite: 15, 67]. [cite_start]The project consists of 10 levels of increasing complexity solved through a simulated web interface[cite: 68, 71].

## Instructions
### Running the Interface
1. [cite_start]Download and extract the project files[cite: 76, 77].
2. [cite_start]Execute the `run.sh` script in your terminal to launch the web server and open the interface[cite: 78, 209].
3. [cite_start]If `run.sh` fails, manually run the command `python3 -m http.server 49242` and navigate to `http://localhost:49242` in your browser[cite: 93].

### Solving and Exporting
* [cite_start]Enter your intranet login into the interface to load your personal configuration[cite: 83, 95].
* [cite_start]Modify the unshaded fields in the network diagram to achieve the goals listed at the top of the page[cite: 136, 191].
* [cite_start]Use the **[Check again]** button to verify your configuration and use the logs at the bottom of the page to debug errors[cite: 138, 153].
* [cite_start]Once a level is complete, use the **[Get my config]** button to export your configuration before proceeding to the next level[cite: 139, 150].

### Submission Requirements
* [cite_start]You must submit exactly 10 configuration files (one for each level) to the root of your Git repository[cite: 210, 220].
* [cite_start]The `README.md` must be located at the root of the repository[cite: 199].

## Resources
### Networking Concepts
[cite_start]The following concepts were studied and applied to complete this project[cite: 208]:
* [cite_start]**TCP/IP Addressing:** Understanding how data is routed between hosts[cite: 67].
* [cite_start]**Subnet Masks:** Defining the boundaries of a network segment[cite: 67].
* [cite_start]**Default Gateways:** Configuring the exit point for traffic destined for outside the local network[cite: 15, 67].
* [cite_start]**Routers and Switches:** Understanding how these devices connect different segments[cite: 194].
* [cite_start]**OSI Layers:** Conceptualizing the stack through which data travels[cite: 208].

### AI Usage
* **Tasks assisted by AI:** [e.g., Drafting the structure of this README and clarifying subnetting math].
* [cite_start]**Project parts:** [e.g., Documentation and theoretical research][cite: 205].
* [cite_start]**Ethical approach:** AI was used to reduce repetitive tasks while ensuring all generated logic was manually verified and fully understood[cite: 26, 30].
