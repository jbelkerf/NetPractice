# NetPractice

 *This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by jbelkerf*

## Description
NetPractice is a practical exercise designed to introduce the basics of computer networking. The project involves configuring small-scale networks to make them function properly by understanding TCP/IP addressing, subnet masks, and default gateways. To complete this assignment, 10 simulated networking levels must be solved.

## Instructions
### How to run the training interface
* Download the file attached to the project's page.
* Extract the files into a folder and run the `run.sh` script.
* If `run.sh` does not work, run `python3 -m http.server 49242` and navigate to `http://localhost:49242` in your browser.
* Enter your intranet login into the interface to use your personal configuration.

### How to export configurations
* Once a level is successfully completed, click the **[Get my config]** button.
* Export one configuration file for each of the 10 levels before moving to the next.

### Submission Requirements
* A total of 10 exported configuration files (one per level) must be placed at the root of the repository.
* The `README.md` file must be provided at the root of the Git repository.

## Resources
### Networking Concepts
The following concepts were studied and applied to complete the project levels:
* **TCP/IP Addressing:** Configuring how devices identify and communicate with each other.
* **Subnet Masks:** Defining the boundaries and size of network segments.
* **Default Gateways:** Establishing the path for traffic leaving the local network.
* **Routers and Switches:** Connecting multiple devices and directing data flow.
* **OSI Layers:** Understanding the conceptual framework of network communication.

### AI Usage
* **Tasks:** [e.g., Explaining subnetting logic and drafting this documentation]. 
* **Project Parts:** [e.g., Used for theoretical research and README structure]. 
* **Ethical Consideration:** AI was used to reduce repetitive tasks. Only AI-generated content that was fully understood and verified was used. All results were critically assessed and reviewed.
